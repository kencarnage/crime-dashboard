project that features NYPD Crime Dataset from 2019 to 2024.

# DATASET
dataset can be found on [Open NYC DATA](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Current-Year-To-Date-/5uac-w243/about_data)

# Further plans
I plan on training a Generative ML model on the whole dataset to predict the location and time of potential crimes.
